# ChesscatPlusPlus

ChesscatPlusPlus is the actively developed version of Chesscat, a library meant to simplify implementations of chess games in other programs. It supports move validation and generation and has a flexible movement system which allows custom variants to be easily implemented.
There is no official release currently, but it can be built together with [ChesscatPlusPlusWeb](https://github.com/2myaus/ChesscatPlusPlusWeb) to view a working demo using WebAssembly.
